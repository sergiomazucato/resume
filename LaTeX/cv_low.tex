%Dear Recruiter,
%thank you for reading this message. I will provide you a brief introduction of my profile and my motivation to apply on this position.
%I have studied electrical engineering (power electronics and control) in Brazil at UTFPR, in Germany I have done an ERASMUS at FH-Zwickau. Before engineering, I have studied Economics but it was not math-worth as expected and I joined college again.
%At the engineering school I felt realized, dealing with subjects I appreciate was really pleasant. I was teacher assistant in some lectures and  researcher in a control study group. Some papers were written and published, in one of those paper I was awarded by the biggest electrical engineers institute (IEEE) of the world.
%By the end of my graduation I did an internship at an Electronics Manufacturer company in the application engineering department (some technical-commercial paper were published in this internship) and after graduation I was hired by Gemalto, to work with embedded software for smart cards. After mastering the issues of the area my career went to a Project Management path and it is getting every day a bit deeper in this area. However, it is unfortunately not appreciated considering what I really like to do. Due the aforementioned drawback, I decided to do a step back in my career and come back to a technical position.

%You will find more details about my profession experience on the next page. Please feel comfortable to contact me if you need further information.

%Best regards,
%Sergio Mazucato
